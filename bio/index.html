<h4> Scene </h4>

<div class="blurb">
	<p class="ex1">
		I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. I always possessed the desire to attend college but had very little idea of what I wanted to become. 
		I was offered scholarships to a few universities to play soccer, including Rockford University and Xavier in Chicago, IL. 
		After a lot of thought, my heart kept me in Milwaukee near to my family. Pursuit of education ensued at the <a href="http://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a>.

<h4> Undergrad </h4>

<div class="blurb">
	<p class="ex1">
		Prior to declaring psychology as my undergraduate major of study, my chosen coursework focused on topics in philosophy, language, anthropology, mythology, and other general studies. 
		With a family history of attorneys on my father’s side, I had placed myself in-line to attend law school after undergrad. For much of my undergrad, I worked in a local law firm in downtown Milwaukee, gaining professional and legal experience. 
		Then came Psychology; my experience in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s undergraduate program through the department of psychology</a> centered my interests in topics of cognition and neuroscience. 
		Not to make things more difficult, admission into Dr. Deborah Hannula’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab</a>, and collaboration with the very wonderful graduate and post-doc members, 
		routed these interests into a sharpened scope of practice.

<div class="blurb">
	<p class="ex1">
		After I completed my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a>, I decided to take some time away from school to advance my professional experiences. 
		After a bit of confusion, followed by an enlightening personal life decision, on July 11th of 2016 I assumed the position of Clinical Research Associate in the 
		<em>Warren Neuroscience Lab</em> – <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">Department of Neurological Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a> alongside 
		<a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren</a> and the exceptional <a href= "https://www.unmc.edu/neurologicalsciences/about/faculty/index.html">faculty</a>.

<h4> UNMC </h4><b />

<div class="blurb">
	<p class="ex1">
		I am so excited to continue under the mentorship of <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren</a> as I have already learned so much in just the first few months here at <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">UNMC</a>. I will be strengthening my skills with eye-tracking methods and learning: 
		administration of neuropsychological tests, use of various neuroimaging tools and techniques, administration of neurostimulation – WOW!, how to work with populations with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, 
		and I am sure, many other skills not reported here.
